This code is for detecting fraud transactions using python using 3 machine learning models and we will be using credit dataset from the kaggle.

Description: This is my online internship project and I created this code based on other codes and modified the code and dataset according to my requirements. I used 3 ML models and compared the accuracy and effieciency of the 3 models via graphs.

Dataset: I took this dataset from kaggle which contains 284315 rows of normal transaction and 492 fraud transaction. Due to the large size I reduced data set size to 4007 rows which contain 3491 normal transaction and 516 fraud transaction. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
